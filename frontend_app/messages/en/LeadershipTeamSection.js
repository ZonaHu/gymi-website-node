      'Hey everyone, I’m Christine and I’m currently a medical student at Harvard University. I recently graduated from Columbia where I studied Neuroscience and Hispanic Studies and co-founded GYMI with Shermin. GYMI has absolutely been a turning point in my life and has enabled me to meet many new friends, connect with new communities and work with passionate people around the world. I’m interested in applying the lessons I’ve learned with starting GYMI to new projects, maybe this time in healthcare! Outside of school and work, I love to try new foods with friends and explore!',

      'Hi! I’m a senior at Columbia University studying Engineering Management System. My journey with GYMI has been the most rewarding experience in my life. I’m super excited to see how GYMI family will grow and thrive as a whole in the future! My personal goal is to build a fashion-tech company that can remove frictions in the way people shop and style themselves. I run away from cities and solo backpack to some place where no one knows who I am every couple months. Love reading and writing. Have a passion for street dance, music, food and puppies. And I’m an aurora chaser.',

      'I graduated from University of Minnesota with majors in Psychology and Human Resources Development in December 2015. I am now working full-time as a HR professional as well as being the Vice President of HR for GYMI. Born and raised in China, I really appreciate the journey I have taken since I was 16 to experience the US education, which made who I am and inspired me to join GYMI. Working with GYMI allows me to give back as it supports students with advanced access to discover who they are and pursue their interest. I enjoy traveling, reading, trying out new food, and wine tasting. Working on getting certified for scuba diving.',

      'I am a graduate student in the University of Minnesota—Twin Cities and my program is Educational Leadership and Policy. My undergraduate major was Dramatic Literature and Script Writing for films and TV shows. I worked as a middle school English teacher in an international school in China for four years. Before that, I also thought Mandarin to international adults and Chinese literature to Chinese middle schoolers. I am highly interested in intercultural communication, feminist critical theories, and gender studies. Those interests have provided me a fundamental possibility of being a successful graduate student in the education field. Overall, my wide range of interests have already confirmed my tendency of intercultural and international development of education. I hope through GYMI, I will be able to help Chinese students with more study skills and perspectives about life. I believe I also can improve my abilities in all aspects with the help of all the colleagues.',
