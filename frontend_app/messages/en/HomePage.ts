    defaultMessage: '<p>This past summer, GYMI has been busy hosting several awesome summer camps! ' +
      'GYMI camps ranged from rural areas in Guizhou to suburban Hangzhou and Quzhou schools for ' +
      'children under the poverty line. We were able to collect funds from multiple media ' +
      'resources and direct them to where they are most needed.</p>' +

      '<p>GYMI camps are unlike other traditional volunteer programs. We build unique mentor-mentee ' +
      'relationships by enfocing a low mentor to mentee ratio. Our mentors teach classes on ' +
      'subjects that they experienced in and accompany their mentees to other mentor-taught ' +
      'classes.</p>' +

      '<p>These classes focus on creativity and critical thinking, including subjects such ' +
      'as computer science, public speaking, drama, arts and crafts, etc. At the end of each ' +
      'two-week session, the mentees each display a finished art/drama project in addition to ' +
      'making a speech about their dreams and goals for the future. Following the speech, ' +
      'mentors and mentees work together to create a one year long follow-up project to help ' +
      'the mentee achieve their goals.</p>' +

      '<p>Ultimately, not only does this setup help the mentees achieve a personal dream, but ' +
      'also, the mentors are able to recognize thier own potential as future leaders or great ' +
      'teachers.</p>'
