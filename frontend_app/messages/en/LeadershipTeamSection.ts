I recently graduated from Columbia where I studied Neuroscience and Hispanic Studies and co-founded GYMI with Shermin. GYMI has absolutely been a turning point in my life and has enabled me to meet many new friends, connect with new communities and work with passionate people around the world. I’m interested in applying the lessons I’ve learned with starting GYMI to new projects, maybe this time in healthcare! Outside of school and work, I love to try new foods with friends and explore!',

I am highly interested in intercultural communication, feminist critical theories, and gender studies. Those interests have provided me a fundamental possibility of being a successful graduate student in the education field. Overall, my wide range of interests have already confirmed my tendency of intercultural and international development of education.
